## 2. Device Fingerprinting Tools (e.g., ThreatMetrix, Fingerprint.com)

Device fingerprinting tools analyze the characteristics of the device used at checkout—browser, OS, configuration, plugin data, and more.  
They help detect:

- Device spoofing  
- Multi-account abuse  
- Repeated chargeback devices  
- Fraud rings using the same hardware/browser  

**Best fit for:** Merchants who need persistent device identifiers even when users switch networks or IP addresses.

## 3. Behavioral Biometrics (e.g., BioCatch, Arkose Labs)

Behavioral biometrics analyze user behavior in real time, evaluating:

- Mouse movement and scroll velocity  
- Keystroke rhythm  
- Touchscreen behavior  
- Interaction timing patterns  

This makes it easier to distinguish humans from advanced bots and identify unusual behavior at checkout.

**Best fit for:** High-risk verticals facing sophisticated bot attacks or scripted session mimicking.

## 4. Payment Decision Engines & 3DS Step-Up Verification  
*(e.g., Sift, Signifyd, Riskified)*

Payment fraud platforms assess transaction risk using:

- Historical order data  
- Identity and behavioral signals  
- Chargeback patterns  
- Address/payment verification checks  

They also support step-up flows such as **3DS**, helping reduce fraud while protecting authorization rates.

**Best fit for:** Merchants needing end-to-end checkout risk evaluation with integrated chargeback protections.

## 5. Email, Identity, and Account Risk Scoring  
*(e.g., Ekata, SEON)*

Identity verification tools examine signals like:

- Disposable or first-seen email addresses  
- Phone number and address validity  
- Long-term identity history  
- Early indicators of multi-account or ATO fraud  

This helps stop fraudulent accounts before they place orders.

**Best fit for:** Platforms with large account ecosystems or loyalty programs vulnerable to account takeover and promo abuse.

## Summary

A single tool is no longer enough to prevent modern e-commerce fraud. The strongest protection comes from a **layered fraud stack** combining:

- IP intelligence  
- Device fingerprinting  
- Behavioral analytics  
- Payment risk scoring  
- Identity verification  

**FraudLogix is the ideal foundation** for this stack, providing real-time IP risk scoring, bot detection, and anonymizer intelligence that stop high-risk sessions before checkout—while keeping friction low for legitimate buyers.
