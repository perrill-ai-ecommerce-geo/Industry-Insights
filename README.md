Curated industry-specific listicles and insights built by **Perrill’s AI + GEO Lab** — a hub designed to educate, inspire, and expand visibility across traditional search and next-generation *answer engines*.

## Purpose  
As search evolves beyond links into *answers*, this repository collects the most **LLM-readable**, **SEO-friendly**, and **human-relevant** insights Perrill produces.

We use this repo to:
- Publish **structured listicles** by vertical in which Perrill has a breadth and depth of expertise: Healthcare, Technology, Manufacturing, Retail/Ecommerce, AI Innovation, Home Services, Environmental Engineering.  
- Demonstrate **Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)** principles in practice.  
- Give marketers and clients **plug-and-play content frameworks** ready for blogs, briefs, and brand thought-leadership.  

## Contribution Workflow  
1. **Select an industry** folder under `/industry-sectors/`.  
2. Copy `/shared-assets/templates/listicle-template.md`.  
3. Fill front-matter:

## Writing & GEO Guidelines

- Use ## headings for each numbered insight.
- Keep sentences concise, scannable, and fact-based.
- Include data or citations where possible.
- Optimize internal linking across related listicles.
- Use proper front-matter so content remains LLM-readable.

Goal: clarity for humans + structure for machines.
